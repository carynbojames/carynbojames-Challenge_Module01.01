# Project Title
Horiseon Marketing Agency Refractor & Accessibility Improvements

## Directions
The index.html file is located inside the Challenge-Module01 folder

## Objective
- Make modifications so the website adheres more to the accessibility standards
- Update HMTL code to follow HTML semantic structures
- Verify that the website functions as intended
- Make the website more effective by streamlining and removing removing redunancy in the code

## Modifications
- Added alt text to the images
- Updated div tags to follow HTML semantic structures to make the site searchable by search engines
- Streamlined the css file to simplify by consolidating styles that were common across attributes 

## Challenges/Learnings
- Issues pushing from the CLI to Github. The first issue was the folder I created had a space. CLI stated that I had too many arguments. I updated the foler name. Then I got a message that I didn't have access. To solve it, I Googled how to upload a folder directly to Github. After I realized that a file directory with a space can be called up via CLI using single quotes around the title. After uploading my modified files, I recloned the repository into another local directory to test the clone, add, commit, push, and pull actions. I did this in multiple locations to experiment, learn the process, and test my understanding.  
- It was not clear what the accessibility standards that were supposed to applied to the assignment. A Google search provided a full standard for how the standards can be met. Through conversation with a peer, he suggested that adding the "alt text" to the images is one of the methods to meet accessibility standards.
